*I shall not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: _it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience.*  
— [Karl Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, 1959. p 18][popper]

These are my thoughts on various work related topics.
